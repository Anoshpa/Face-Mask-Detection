# Facial-Mask-Detection

Instructions to run the Demo File:

1) Block-1 : Import Necessary Modules = Run the cell to load the necessary modules required for functioning of this Demo file
2) Block-2 : Import all Module .py files = Run this cell to load the user made module .py files which contains all the necessary functions used for detection
3) Block-3 : Dataset Path and Hyper Parameters = Run this cell to set dataset path and hyper parameters
4) Block-4 : Load Dataset = Run this block to load Train and Test dataset
5) Block-5 : Sample from Dataset = Run this block to see a sample image from our loaded dataset
6) Block-6 : Load Model(if applicable) = Run this cell if you already have a pre-trained model saved and want to directly start predicting
7) Block-7 : Build Model(if not loaded already) = Run this cell if you didnot already have a pre-trained model and wanna create a model
8) Block-8 : Train Model = Run this cell to trian the newly created model on the training dataset provided the hyper parameters as arguements
9) Block-9 : Model Training History = Run this block to plot newly trained model accuracy as well as loss history on train and validation datasets
10) Block-10 : Evaluate Model = Run this block to evaluate pre-trained or newly created model using precision, recall AUC and ROC curve
11) Block-11 : Sample Detections = Run this cell to perform face mask detection on some sample images
12) Block-12 : Difficult Sample Detection = Run this cell to perform face mask detection on a more complex and difficult sample image

Thank you for reading the execution instructions :)
